# Portfolio Repository for Youwe Agency

This repository showcases some of my portfolio work organized into two main folders: **Front-End** and **Back-End**. Inside each folder, you’ll find code snippets from various projects I have completed. I am happy to provide a live demo of the code in production during our interview call.

## Backend

### CRM Checkout Extension
A custom extension developed for a client who needed to verify the user's email address at checkout. If a user has previously availed a free product, the extension removes the product from the cart. This extension communicates with a Heroku server, which interfaces with the client's CRM to retrieve customer information.

### FTP Inventory Check
A script designed to streamline inventory updates across multiple CSV files that a client shares with their B2B partners. The script retrieves the latest inventory data from Shopify and updates it in the relevant CSV files accordingly.

### Shopify Public App
A Shopify app that displays a leaderboard on collection pages. This leaderboard allows admins to sort products based on metrics like the number of orders and unique customers.

## Front-End

### Cart Incentive
In Shopify, I prioritize using Liquid for UI creation over JavaScript to maintain better control over server-side objects. Where possible, I create empty layouts that I populate dynamically via API calls. This feature calculates each user’s qualified incentive and displays it within the cart drawer.

### Quick Order Form
Developed for a B2B website, this quick order form allows users to search for and purchase multiple items in bulk. It simplifies the purchasing process, enabling users to add items to the cart without navigating through individual product pages.

### Similar Products
A feature that displays similar products based on SKU, helping users discover related items seamlessly.
